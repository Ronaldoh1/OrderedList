Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...";

//Function takes two paramenters:
//1. a String representing a text document and 2) an Integer providing the number of items to return.

//The function returns a list of Strings ordered by word frequency, the most frequent occurring word first. The solutions should run in O(n) where n is the number of of words in the document.

/* 1. check if the "file" is empty. 
 2. We need to ignore case sensitive
 3. Remove puntuation or ignore it. 
 4. Convert string to NSDictonary and keep count of the their frequency. 
    a) If the word exist, simply update the frequncy of the word for that dictionary. 
    b) if the word does not exists, you need add it to the dictionary and increment the requncy by 1.
